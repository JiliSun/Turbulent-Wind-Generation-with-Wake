# Turbulent-Wind-Generation-with-Wake

The turbulent wind field generator with a wake profile is developed based on similar modelling principles as TurbSim, with the integration of Gaussian-based wake deficit distribution. Waked inflow could be modelled for the aero-elastic simulations of downstream turbines impacted by wake effects within a wind farm. Specifically, the turbulent wind field with wake feature could be generated as BTS files, which could then be used as the wind input for OpenFAST. The modified turbulent wind field generator with the integration of Gaussian-based wake deficit distribution is developed based on the 3D Turbulent Wind Generation, which can be found at: https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/54491-3d-turbulent-wind-generation

Further details of the wind field generation with wake modelling are presented in the paperï¼š
